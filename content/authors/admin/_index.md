**Benvignût!** This is my personal webpage. I am a PostDoc at the University of Udine, affiliated with the [Social, Media, Data & Crowd Laboratory](https://smdc.uniud.it/smdc/en/members/), and I hold a Ph.D. in Computer Science, Mathematics, and Physics.

My main research interests include Human Computation, Crowdsourcing, and Information Retrieval. Currently, I am focused on leveraging crowdsourcing to address the growing challenge of misinformation spread.

In my free time, I enjoy discovering new literature and work towards being a decent runner, hiker, and skier.
