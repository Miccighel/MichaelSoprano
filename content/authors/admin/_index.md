Hello! I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the University of Udine.

I successfully defended my Ph.D. dissertation on May 22nd, 2023, and I plan to release it publicly soon. In 2021, I wrote a brief research statement {{< staticref "media/research-statement.pdf" "newtab" >}}research statement{{< /staticref >}}.

My research interest centers around utilizing crowdsourcing-based approaches to address the ever-increasing problem of misinformation spread. As a long-term goal, I would like to leverage my skills in Computer Science to make a lasting contribution to the scientific community.

{{< icon name="download" pack="fas" >}} Download my Curriculum Vitae in {{< staticref "media/Curriculum_EN.pdf" "newtab" >}}English{{< /staticref >}} or {{< staticref "media/Curriculum_IT.pdf" "newtab" >}}Italian{{< /staticref >}}, and feel free to explore my {{< staticref "media/masterThesis.pdf" "newtab" >}}Master's{{< /staticref >}}, {{< staticref "media/bachelorThesis.pdf" "newtab" >}}Bachelor's{{< /staticref >}}, or {{< staticref "media/highSchoolThesis.pdf" "newtab" >}}High School{{< /staticref >}} theses.
