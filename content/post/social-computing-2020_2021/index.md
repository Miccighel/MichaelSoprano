## Teachers

- [Stefano Mizzaro](https://users.dimi.uniud.it/~stefano.mizzaro/ "Stefano Mizzaro") - Theory
- **Michael Soprano** - Laboratory

## Aims

The aim of the course is to provide to the student the foundational knowledge and the 
practical skills concerning the area of social informatics. 
The course discusses both the so-called Social Media (Facebook, Twitter, etc.) 
and the Crowdsourcing phenomenon. In the first case, social behavior is supported by 
computational systems; in the second case, computational systems are supported by social behavior. 
The course deals with conceptual topics, theoretical foundations, and practical applications.

## Table of Contents

My contribution to the course consisted in teaching practical applications of the concepts outlined by prof. Stefano Mizzaro 
for a total of 6 lectures (12 hours). The course's language is Italian.
