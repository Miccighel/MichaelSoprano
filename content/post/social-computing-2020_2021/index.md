## Teachers

- [Stefano Mizzaro](https://users.dimi.uniud.it/~stefano.mizzaro/ "Stefano Mizzaro") - Theory
- **Michael Soprano** - Laboratory

## Aims

The aim of the course is to provide to the student the foundational knowledge and the practical skills concerning the area of social informatics. The course discusses both the so-called Social Media (
Facebook, Twitter, etc.)and the Crowdsourcing phenomenon. In the first case, social behavior is supported by computational systems; in the second case, computational systems are supported by social
behavior. The course deals with conceptual topics, theoretical foundations, and practical applications.

## Table of Contents

I contributed to the course by teaching practical applications of the concepts outlined by Professor Stefano Mizzaro in a total of 6 lectures (12 hours). Additionally, I assigned course assignment to
the students. The course is conducted in Italian.
