The aim of the course is to equip students with the skills, terminology, and methodologies needed for data analysis and processing, with a particular focus on sports-related applications. The course
prepares students for advanced studies at the master's level by providing practical skills that extend beyond the sports domain and fostering a broader understanding of data analysis techniques in
various contexts.
