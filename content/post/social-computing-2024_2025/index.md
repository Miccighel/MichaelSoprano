## Teachers

- [Stefano Mizzaro](https://users.dimi.uniud.it/~stefano.mizzaro/ "Stefano Mizzaro") - Theory
- **Hafska Akebli** - Laboratory (Part 1-2)
- **Michele Lizzit** - Laboratory (Part 1-2)
- **Michael Soprano** - Laboratory (Part 2)

## Aims

The aim of the course is to provide students with foundational knowledge and practical skills in the area of social informatics. The course discusses both the so-called social media (Facebook,
Twitter, etc.) and the crowdsourcing phenomenon.

In the first case, social behavior is supported by computational systems; in the second case, computational systems are supported by social behavior. The course addresses conceptual topics,
theoretical foundations, and practical applications.

## Table of contents

I contributed to the course by providing a lecture on Crowd_Frame, a framework I developed for the design and deployment of crowdsourcing tasks (2 hours). Additionally, I provided the students with
their second course assignment. The course is conducted in Italian.
