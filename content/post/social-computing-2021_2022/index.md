## Teachers

- [Stefano Mizzaro](https://users.dimi.uniud.it/~stefano.mizzaro/ "Stefano Mizzaro") - Theory
- **Michael Soprano** - Laboratory

## Aims

The aim of the course is to provide students with foundational knowledge and practical skills in the area of social informatics. The course discusses both the so-called social media (Facebook, Twitter, etc.) and the crowdsourcing phenomenon.

In the first case, social behavior is supported by computational systems; in the second case, computational systems are supported by social behavior. The course addresses conceptual topics, theoretical foundations, and practical applications.

## Table of contents

I contributed to the course by teaching the practical applications of the concepts outlined by Professor Stefano Mizzaro in a total of six lectures (12 hours). Additionally, I assigned course assignments to the students. The course is conducted in Italian.
