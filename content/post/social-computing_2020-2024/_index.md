# Aims

The aim of the course is to provide students with foundational knowledge and practical skills in the area of social informatics. The course discusses both the so-called social media (Facebook,
Twitter, etc.) and the crowdsourcing phenomenon.

In the first case, social behavior is supported by computational systems; in the second case, computational systems are supported by social behavior. The course addresses conceptual topics,
theoretical foundations, and practical applications.
