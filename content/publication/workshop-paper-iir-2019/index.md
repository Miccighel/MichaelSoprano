abstract: 'Information retrieval effectiveness evaluation is often carried out by means of test collections. Many works investigated possible sources of bias in such an approach. We propose a systematic approach to identify bias and its causes, and to remove it, thus enforcing fairness in effectiveness evaluation by means of test collections.'
