abstract: 'This paper describes Readersourcing 2.0, an ecosystem providing an implementation of the Readersourcing approach proposed by Mizzaro [10]. Readersourcing is proposed as an alternative to the standard peer review activity that aims to exploit the otherwise lost opinions of readers. Readersourcing 2.0 implements two different models based on the so-called codetermination algorithms. We describe the requirements, present the overall architecture, and show how the end-user can interact with the system. Readersourcing 2.0 will be used in the future to study also other topics, like the idea of shepherding the users to achieve a better quality of the reviews and the differences between a review activity carried out with a single-blind or a double-blind approach.'
