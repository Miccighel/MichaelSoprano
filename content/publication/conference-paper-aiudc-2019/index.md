abstract: We propose an alternative approach to the standard peer review activity
  that aims to exploit the otherwise lost opinions of readers of publications which
  is called Readersourcing, originally proposed by Mizzaro [1]. Such an approach can
  be formalized by means of different models which share the same general principles.
  These models should be able to define a way, to measure the overall quality of a
  publication as well the reputation of a reader as an assessor; moreover, from these
  measures it should be possible to derive the reputation of a scholar as an author.
  We describe an ecosystem called Readersourcing 2.0 which provides an implementation
  for two Readersourcing models [2, 3] by outlining its goals and requirements. Readersourcing
  2.0 will be used in the future to gather fresh data to analyze and validate.
