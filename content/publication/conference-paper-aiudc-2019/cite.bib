 abstract = {We propose an alternative approach to the standard peer review activity that aims to exploit the otherwise lost opinions of readers of publications which is called Readersourcing, originally proposed by Mizzaro [1]. Such an approach can be formalized by means of different models which share the same general principles. These models should be able to define a way, to measure the overall quality of a publication as well the reputation of a reader as an assessor; moreover, from these measures it should be possible to derive the reputation of a scholar as an author. We describe an ecosystem called Readersourcing 2.0 which provides an implementation for two Readersourcing models [2, 3] by outlining its goals and requirements. Readersourcing 2.0 will be used in the future to gather fresh data to analyze and validate.},
