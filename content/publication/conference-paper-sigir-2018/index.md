abstract: 'Several researchers have proposed to reduce the number of topics used in
  TREC-like initiatives. One research direction that has been pursued is what is the
  optimal topic subset of a given cardinality that evaluates the systems/runs in the
  most accurate way. Such a research direction has been so far mainly theoretical,
  with almost no indication on how to select the few good topics in practice. We propose
  such a practical criterion for topic selection: we rely on the methods for automatic
  system evaluation without relevance judgments, and by running some experiments on
  several TREC collections we show that the topics selected on the basis of those
  evaluations are indeed more informative than random topics.'
